# Executive-HR-Dashboard (TABLEAU)
## Project Objective
I created an interactive Executive HR Dashboard in Tableau to analyze key workforce metrics such as attrition, employee demographics, job satisfaction, and education-based trends. The project involved data cleaning, preprocessing, and designing clear visualizations to help HR teams make data-driven decisions.

## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/Siddharth-cyber6/Executive-HR-Dashboard/blob/main/HR%20Data.xlsx">HR Dataset</a>

## Process

- Imported the HR dataset into Tableau for analysis.
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and ensure data accuracy.
- Created calculated fields and KPIs to derive key HR metrics such as attrition rate, active employees, and age groups.
- Designed interactive visualizations including pie charts, bar charts, heatmaps, and donut charts.
- Added filters and parameters (Education filter, Age Bin slider) to enable dynamic data exploration.
- Built a unified, user-friendly Executive HR Dashboard with a customized theme and background for better readability and insights.

## Project Insight
- The organization has a total of 1,470 employees, among which 237 employees have left, resulting in an attrition rate of 16.12%.
- The Sales and R&D departments show the highest attrition, indicating potential workload or satisfaction issues.
- Employees in the 25–34 age group represent the largest portion of the workforce and also show notable attrition numbers.
- Most attrition occurs among individuals with Life Sciences, Medical, and Marketing educational backgrounds.
- Job satisfaction is highest among Sales Executives and Research Scientists, while roles like Human Resources and Managers show lower satisfaction levels.
- Gender-based analysis shows higher attrition among males, especially in the 25–34 age group.

## Final Conclusion
To improve workforce stability and reduce attrition, the company should prioritize retention strategies for the Sales and R&D departments, where employee turnover is most prominent. Strengthening engagement and career development programs for the 25–34 age group, which forms the core of the workforce, can have significant impact. Additionally, departments with lower job satisfaction should be re-evaluated for workload balance, leadership quality, and growth opportunities. Tailored initiatives for high-attrition education groups and targeted support for male employees can further enhance retention efforts and overall organizational performance.
